# Cross-Border Payment System

## Overview

This repository contains a blockchain-based cross-border payment system designed to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient international money transfers. The system leverages smart contracts to manage identity verification, currency conversion, transaction processing, and regulatory compliance.

## Key Components

### Identity Verification Contract
Validates sender and recipient information to ensure secure transactions and prevent fraud. Implements KYC (Know Your Customer) standards and maintains privacy compliance across different jurisdictions.

### Currency Conversion Contract
Manages exchange rates between different currencies, providing real-time conversion with minimal spreads. Interfaces with reliable oracle services to fetch current market rates.

### Transaction Processing Contract
Handles the movement of funds from sender to recipient, ensuring atomic transactions with proper settlement confirmation. Manages transaction fees and provides detailed transaction history.

### Compliance Monitoring Contract
Ensures adherence to international regulations including AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. Implements jurisdiction-specific rules and provides audit trails for regulatory review.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to a blockchain testnet

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cross-border-payment.git
cd cross-border-payment
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file
2. Configure blockchain network settings in `truffle-config.js` or `hardhat.config.js`
3. Deploy contracts to your preferred testnet

## Usage

Detailed API documentation is available in the `/docs` directory. Basic workflow:

1. Register user identities through the verification contract
2. Initiate transfer with currency and amount details
3. System performs compliance checks and currency conversion
4. Funds are transferred to recipient upon successful validation

## Security Considerations

This system implements multiple security measures including:
- Multi-signature authorization for large transactions
- Rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks
- Comprehensive input validation
- Encrypted storage of sensitive information
